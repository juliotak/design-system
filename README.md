# BIREME-UI Design System

> A unified design system for BIREME/PAHO/WHO to deliver consistent, accessible, and scalable digital experiences across platforms.

## ✨ Overview

BIREME-UI is a customizable design system built on top of [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com), tailored for the needs of the BIREME/PAHO/WHO digital ecosystem. It standardizes components, color tokens, typography, and interaction patterns to promote brand consistency and efficient development.

## 🔧 Features

- 🎨 **Theming:** Custom theme based on Chakra UI using color, opacity, and typography tokens managed via Tokens Studio.
- 📦 **Reusable Components:** A curated library of accessible React components aligned with BIREME's visual identity.
- 📚 **Documentation:** Live, interactive component documentation using Storybook and Zeroheight.
- 🌍 **Internationalization-ready:** Designed with multilingual support in mind.
- 🧩 **Design Tokens:** Tokenized design values exported in JSON for seamless integration between design and development.
